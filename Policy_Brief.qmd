# Evaluate whether we should encourage Airbnb operation in relationship to hotels: A Cultural perspective

## Greater London Authority Briefing: Arts & Culture

*Instruction:*

*The briefing will be written as if to update the Mayor of the Greater London Authority on the challenges/opportunities relating to Airbnb’s operations in London. As such, the Policy Briefing will begin with a short Summary, including Key Findings and, if desired, Recommendations; this will typically be followed by a brief review of the evidence from London (and potentially elsewhere, if relevant) and an analysis supported by the data. Your analysis will be supported using appropriately selected and generated tables, charts, and maps.*

## Background (650)

### Role of culture in the city
Culture is an important tool for tourism and urban development. According to Mayor of London, 4 out of 5 travellers indicated ‘culture’ as their main reason for visiting London, contributing £52 billion each year to London’s economy (n.d.). London’s varied cultural offerings constitutes of world class destinations such as the Buckingham Palace, the West End and internationally acclaimed museums. Not only that, London is also at the heart of emergent culture, with a vibrant music scene, night life, and diverse culture – a hotbed for creativity. With the rise of Airbnb, the distribution of travel accommodations has dispersed from traditionally central London, towards the periphery of the city where emergent are located. This brief explores how Airbnb operations interact with London’s cultural infrastructure and its hotel industry, with aims to suggest regulatory policies that allows local residents to benefit from Airbnb, control gentrification, whilst protecting the hotel industry.

### Airbnb in London
Airbnb brands itself as a tool for the sharing economy, where property owners are given the opportunity to let temporarily vacant rooms or properties for short-term stays. Airbnb has proven to be beneficial for local residents to temporarily let our parts of their home to visitors, providing an alternative source of income as well as accumulating the tourist dollar in the local area. **find readings/stats.** However, the digital platform has also been heavily criticised for its impact on accelerating gentrification. According to studies, this phenomenon is driven by the increasingly professionalisation of Airbnb, which is also continuously contributing to London's affordability crisis (Wachsmuth and Weisler 2018; Harris 2018; Lee 2016). Professional hosts - i.e. those with more than one Airbnb listing, often buy up existing housing stock in culturally desirable areas to let out on Airbnb, earning up to 16.9% higher daily revenue on their properties than non-professional hosts (Li et al. 2015). This does not only reduce available housing stock for permanent residents, it also drives up prices of local properties and goods and services, further displacing local Londoners.

###Airbnb and Hotels
The digital platform has significantly disrupted the hotel industry since it entered the market in 2015. While hotels were one of the few options for travel accommodations, Airbnb has taken a larger scale of the market at the moment by providing a wide variety of dwelling types, cheaper rental prices and a sense of authenticity. Studies have shown that the Hotel industry has lost XXX in profit since the dawn of Airbnb. Some have argued Airbnb has directly plummeted travel bookings in hotels. **The hotel industry….. ***From a regulatory perspective, the well monitored, well taxed, established hotel industries, often located in the culturally dense areas needs to be protected. However some might argue the opposite. As studies found, Airbnb and hotels fulfil a different type of accommodation needs, such that they do not directly compete with each other.

## Objectives (200)

### Given the benefit airbnb brings into the culture economy, should we encourage its operations?

### If so, where so that it does not undermine the hotel industry?

### Is there unrealised opportunity for hotels in areas with medium cultural density and medium airbnb density?

- We want to keep hotels going because of good established tax and regulations.

## Summary of Key Findings (200)

Identified 5 categories in the airbnb, cuture, hotel triad.

## Extended Results/Policy Discussion (850)

**ISSUE WITH THIS ANALYSIS: COMPARING COUNTS OF HOTELS AND AIRBNBS. ONE HOTEL CAN SERVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE BUT ONLLY COUNTS AS ONE POINT ON THE MAP**

5 distinct groups were identified using the cluster analysis, allowing neighbourhoods of London with potential for more  AirBnB's to be recognised. 

In Figure x, those areas with relatively low hotel density, and medium cultural and AirBnB density suggest that AirBnBs are a more mobile method of accommodation that follow cultural amenities. This is due to the inherent nature both forms face. Hotels are constrained to one locale, due to their more extensive regulation and operating cost. AirBnBs are more flexibile, on account of their (something to do with sharing economy; Li and Srinivasan,  2019)

A key takeaway from this map is how few areas with high or medium hotel density there are: these are the red, green, and purple areas. The orange areas, which dominate most of central London and its surrounds, have relatively higher concentrations of Airbnbs. An important policy question for London is whether this imbalance represents a problem or opportunity for the city.

### Case Study: Westminster - what counts as culture? 

The borough of Westminster contains some counterintuitive results results. It contains areas matching all five classifications - ranging from blue (low in all three categories) to red (medium-to-high in all three categories). This could either be due to Westminster's specific character, or to a vulnerability in the underlying data. Given that Westminster contains major tourist attractions such as Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace, as well as parts of London's theatre district, it is unlikely to be the former. This means that interrogating these findings with ground-truthed local knowledge is important to verifying and testing them.

### Case Study: Croydon  
Airbnb acts as an accelerator for culture, providing accommodation in areas of emerging cultural development, what the hotel industry can’t immediately accommodate. Croydon is a prime example of such. Located in zone 5, Croydon has won a £1 million bid in cultural funding, named the London Borough of Culture of 2023. Recognised for its emerging cultural importance within London, in particular, Boxpark, Croydon Pride Festival, the prominent black-led Talawa Theatre Company and The Ends music Festival, Croydon serves as a cultural hub for black British culture, and attracting much more. Airbnb’s flexible operations had encouraged extra-Croydon visitors.  

### Case study: East London  
Outside of the core cluster in central London, a node of 'culture dense' neighbourhoods is identified in East London, centred on Shoreditch and Spitalfields, and stretching outward to Haggerston, Dalston and Bethnal Green. These neighbourhoods are characterised by a high density of music venues and pubs in close proximity with artist workspaces, studios, creative co-working spaces, and community centres. Like other neighbourhoods in the 'culture dense' cluster, these areas have well-established cultural institutions, creative communities, or night time economies, or a combination of all three. *add refs on gentrification in Shoreditch, Hackney* 


*Notes on Cluster Zero (for reference; not for inclusion in final report)*

Cluster zero is characterised by areas that contain the highest density of cultural points but a medium level of Airbnb listings and hotels, comparative to the whole of Greater London. The cluster is restricted to inner-city boroughs, in areas with well-established cultural institutions, creative communities, and night-time economies. The key neighbourhoods identified were:  

1. Central London, encompassing Covent Garden, Soho, and Bloomsbury,

2. Inner East (Shoreditch and Spitalfields),

3. Hackney and Mid East, centred around Dalston, Haggerston and Bethnal Green,

4. Inner North, including Camden Town, King’s Cross, and Islington, and

5. South, at London Bridge and New Cross.  

Central London forms the core of this ‘high culture’ cluster, with a huge variety of cultural points, including the theatres and performance venues of the West End, the galleries, libraries of archives of the British Museum and university campuses in Bloomsbury, and pubs and music venues throughout that fuel the night time economy. The predominance of commercial, cultural and community spaces likely limits the availability of residential housing which could be converted to Airbnb.  In East London, neighbourhoods in Dalston and Haggerston are characterised by a high density of music venues and pubs in close proximity with artist workspaces, creative co-working spaces, and community centres. A similar pattern is evident in Bethnal Green, although with a greater share of galleries and archival spaces. In the south east, New Cross is an anomalous LSOA in identified in Cluster zero. This is likely due to Cockpit Arts, a studio and design space that houses multiple independent artists and design studios, and which forms a key source of cultural infrastructure in the neighbourhood.




## Conclusion (250)

## Appendix: Methodology & Data (100)

Clustering analysis was used to identify broad characteristics of neighnbourhoods (LSOAs) across Greater London. The following three variables were used:

- Hotel Density
- AirBnB Density
- Cultural Density
