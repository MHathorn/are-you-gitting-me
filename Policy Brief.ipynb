    "## UK/ London Housing Market\n",
    "Even before the dawn of Airbnb, London's housing problem haslong been a topic of contention. The Right to Buy Scheme under the Housing Act 1980 allowed tenants to purchase their council homes at a significant discount, where more than 1.8m homes were sold (Foster 2015). Coupled with limited annual addition to social housing stock, the UK has experienced an average annual net loss of 24,000 council homes and rising distorded prices since 1991. (Shelter n.d.) **info on how london current housing prices is amongst the top globally.** As of 2020, 47.3% of London housing tenures were rented, with a plurality (26.6%) housing in the private rental market, subject to growing market volatility and steep price rises (Trust for London nd). Future for London (2017) estimated 40% of Londoners will be private renters by 2030. \n",

    "\n",
    "Airbnb brands itself as a tool for the sharing economy, where property owners are given the opportunity to let temporarily vacant rooms or properties for short-term stays. However, the platform has become increasingly pofessionalised, which is continously contributing to London's afforability crisis and gentrification (Wachsmuth and Weisler 2018; Harris 2018; Lee 2016). Professional hosts - i.e. those with more than one Airbnb listing - earn up to 16.9% higher daily revenue on their properties than non professional hosts (Li et al. 2015). Currently, 45.9 % of Airbnb hosts in London have more than one whole home listing (Inside Airbnb 2022). \n",
